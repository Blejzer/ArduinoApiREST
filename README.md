**Arduino - NodeMCU - NodeJS - BME280**

This project is test on how Arduino gathers information from **BME280**, uses SoftwareSerial to create serial connection to NodeMCU ESP8266 ESP-12F, who acts as web client and sends reveived information to nodeJS server who, in return saves it to mongodb.
All data should be accessable thorugh APIs.

This device is excellent for quickly and easily getting three main parameters of weather conditions.
* Temperature,
* Humidity, and
* Pressure (Pay attention to setting up the altitude).
